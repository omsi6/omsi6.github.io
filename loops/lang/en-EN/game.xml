                <a>Hover over "Stats" for how they work. What stats are important depend on what actions you need that
                    uses them.

                <q>Short runs seem better.</q>
                <a>Short runs are better, for the early game and current balance. As your runs get longer and you accrue
                    talent and soulstones they become more useful.

                    combat training which gives you a permanent boost, and then try fighting monsters!

                you tripped - breaking your glasses - and the package burst open, spilling a strange liquid on you.
                Immediately, your meager amount of mana started draining rapidly. Right as your mana became empty, you
                found yourself back in the moment the liquid was absorbed into your skin, with your tiny reserves
                filled... yet draining just as before. This happened again and again, the world resetting with you,
                until you decided you had to figure out a way to prolong how long these 'loops' were. Mana crystals are
                often stored in pottery around town, perhaps you'll start there ...

                You reach the end of the dungeon, where a softly glowing orb floats on a pedastal. You've found the
                dungeon core - for the first level of the dungeon, at least. As you grasp it, the essence dives into
                you, infusing your very being with the power it holds. It is a small amount of power, but this is a
                small dungeon. You'll be back to take this power again, knowing with the foreign knowledge implanted
                that it will stay with you no matter when you are.

                You reach the end of the dungeon again, but for the first time the core isn't glowing. It's always been
                thought that dungeon cores build based on the mana spent around them, but you're beginning to think the
                essence of it's previous incarnations drains it somehow. It doesn't always happen, but you'll need to
                put more mana into the world to take the core's benefits out of it. You shrug, accepting yet another
                oddity of the loops.

          Each stat level reduces the relevant part of an action's mana cost by 1%.<br>
          Talent gets 1% of all level progress, and persists through loops.<br>
          Talent multiplies xp gain by (1+(talentLevel)^0.4/3).<br>
          XP gain towards a stat per action is (original mana / actual mana) * (talent bonus) per tick.<br>
          Total Mult is a combination of your talent and soulstone bonuses.<br><br>
          e.g. Meet People costs 800 mana and has a breakdown of <div class="bold">Int</div> 10% <div class="bold">Cha</div> 80% <div class="bold">Soul</div> 10%.<br>
          This effectively means 80 of the mana is controlled by <div class="bold">Int</div>, another 80 by <div class="bold">Soul</div>, and the remaining 640 by <div class="bold">Cha</div>.<br>
          If your <div class="bold">Cha</div> is level 20 when the action is started, the bonus would be x1.2 so it'd be 640 / 1.2 = 533.33<br>
          Adding back the 160 from <div class="bold">Soul</div> and <div class="bold">Int</div>, the total mana the action takes (rounded up) is now 694, so ~87% of the original mana cost.<br>
          The action would give (800/694)*(1+(talent)^0.4/3) level exp per mana for the 694 mana.]]></explanation>
