                <q>What should my first goal be?</q>
                <a>Start with wandering until you have ways of getting mana back. Then try to find how to get some
                    warrior lessions to give yourself a permanent boost, and then try fighting monsters!

                You're a simple courier, on a long trip to deliver a high priority package. Just as you entered town,
                you tripped - breaking your glasses - and the package burst open, spilling a strange liquid on you.
                Immediately, your meager amount of mana started draining rapidly. Right as your mana became empty, you
                found yourself back in the moment the liquid was absorbed into your skin, with your tiny reserves
                filled... yet draining just as before. This happened again and again, the world resetting with you,
                until you decided you had to figure out a way to prolong how long these 'loops' were. Mana crystals are
                often stored in pottery around town, perhaps you'll start there ...
            </story>
            <story num="1">
                You reach the end of the dungeon, where a softly glowing orb floats on a pedastal. You've found the
                dungeon core - for the first level of the dungeon, at least. As you grasp it, the essence dives into
                you, infusing your very being with the power it holds. It is a small amount of power, but this is a
                small dungeon. You'll be back to take this power again, knowing with the foreign knowledge implanted
                that it will stay with you no matter when you are.
            </story>
            <story num="2">
                You reach the end of the dungeon again, but for the first time the core isn't glowing. It's always been
                thought that dungeon cores build based on the mana spent around them, but you're beginning to think the
                essence of it's previous incarnations drains it somehow. It doesn't always happen, but you'll need to
                put more mana into the world to take the core's benefits out of it. You shrug, accepting yet another
                oddity of the loops.
            </story>
            <story num="3">
                You've done it! You've won the tournament and obtained the cure. You can stop looping at any moment.
                But, there's still a little more you want to do ... (GAME COMPLETE, keep playing if you want).

          Each stat level reduces the relevant part of an action's mana cost by 1%.<br>
          Talent exp gain is equal to 1% of stat exp gain, and persists through loops.<br>
          Talent multiplies xp gain by (1+(talentLevel)^0.4/3).<br>
          XP gain towards a stat per action is (original mana / actual mana) * (talent bonus) per tick.<br>
          Total Mult is a combination of your talent and soulstone bonuses.<br><br>
          e.g. Meet People costs 800 mana and has a breakdown of <div class="bold">Int</div> 10% <div class="bold">Cha</div> 80% <div class="bold">Soul</div> 10%.<br>
          This effectively means 80 of the mana is controlled by <div class="bold">Int</div>, another 80 by <div class="bold">Soul</div>, and the remaining 640 by <div class="bold">Cha</div>.<br>
          If your <div class="bold">Cha</div> is level 20 when the action is started, the bonus would be x1.2 so it'd be 640 / 1.2 = 533.33<br>
          Adding back the 160 from <div class="bold">Soul</div> and <div class="bold">Int</div>, the total mana the action takes (rounded up) is now 694, so ~87% of the original mana cost.<br>
          The action would give (800/694)*(1+(talent)^0.4/3) level exp per mana for the 694 mana.]]></explanation>

Preparing the altar is surprisingly tame, all said and done. Stone and wood comprise most of the altar and the rest you brought with you when you made this plan. In the end the altar you build is only small, a communion point instead of a summoning. Holding a heart from nearby deer, you pierce it and begin to chant ritualistic words of power. The clearing grows dark and the forest quietens, nary a sound is heard apart from the drip drip drip of the blood from the pierced heart in your hand.

			<story_7><![CDATA[<b>S Rank achieved:</b>⮀ There's only one other S-rank adventurer around, Guildmaster Rannet himself. There aren't any rumours of you being a fake identity this time, because S-rank adventurers are so rare that Rannet personally knows all of them and he's convinced he's never seen you before.

        ]]></tooltip>
			<story_1><![CDATA[<b>1 Chronomancy:</b>⮀ Chronomancy is unlike any other magic you've practiced, and unbelievably finnicky. The mana has to be held perfectly still, as if time is at a standstill, and the slightest mistake will cause the entire spell to destabilize. It's hard work, but you finally get the hang of it and you feel yourself speed up by the barest fraction.]]></story_1>
			<story_2><![CDATA[<b>50 Chronomancy:</b>⮀ The effect is more pronounced now, and you find that your reflexes are keeping up with your increased speed. Unfortunately, though, the mana drain of the loops appears to have kept up as well, so even though you're getting the same amount of work done in less time you can't seem to get more work done in a loop.]]></story_2>

			<story_1><![CDATA[<b>1 Pyromancy:</b>⮀ Pyromancy is more normal than chronomancy, but it makes up for it by being extra dangerous. Fire, you quickly learn, will consume you just as happily as your foes. Your control has to be ironclad at all times or you might lose a hand in the time it takes to draw a breath.]]></story_1>
			<story_2><![CDATA[<b>50 Pyromancy:</b>⮀ Without the loops to restore you to normal you'd probably be dead five times over by now, but the rewards you've gained are impressive indeed. Turning that lethality on monsters is a sight to behold, and it's much more versatile than melee combat. Fights often end before they even have a chance to get close.]]></story_2>
